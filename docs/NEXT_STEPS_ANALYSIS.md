## Priority Matrix

### üî¥ CRITICAL (Next 1-2 Weeks)

**1. CI/CD Pipeline Setup (Issue #20) - HIGHEST PRIORITY**

**Why Critical:**

- Automates quality checks (no manual testing)
- Catches regressions immediately
- Enables confident refactoring in Phase 2
- Provides coverage trend monitoring
- Unlocks automated deployments

**What to Build:**

- GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- Lint + test + build on every PR
- Coverage reporting (Codecov or GitHub Comments)
- Automated deployment to staging (on `develop` merge)
- Automated deployment to production (on `master` merge)
- Rollback mechanism

**Deliverables:**

- CI runs in <5 minutes
- PR checks block merge if tests fail
- Coverage badge in README
- Staging environment auto-deploys
- Production deploys with confirmation

**Estimated Effort:** 24 hours (3 days)

**Risk:** Medium - Requires SSH secrets, deployment testing

**References:**

- Refactoring Plan: Phase 1.2
- Issue #20: Activate GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline

---

**2. Backend Testing (Phase 1.2) - HIGH PRIORITY**

**Why Critical:**

- Backend has 0% test coverage (risky)
- API endpoints need regression protection
- Database queries need validation
- Auth middleware needs testing

**What to Build:**

- Vitest setup in `server/` directory
- API endpoint tests (supertest)
- Database query tests (test database)
- Auth middleware tests (JWT validation)
- Error handling tests

**Target Coverage:** 60%+ backend coverage

**Deliverables:**

- 40+ backend tests
- All API endpoints tested
- Auth flow tested

## Decision Points

### Decision 1: CI/CD vs. Backend Testing Order

**Question:** Should we do CI/CD before or after backend testing?

**Recommendation:** CI/CD FIRST

**Rationale:**

- CI/CD enables automated backend testing in the pipeline
- Faster feedback loop during backend test development
- Can deploy backend tests incrementally (not all at once)
- Automated deployments reduce manual effort

**Order:**

1. CI/CD (24 hours)
2. Backend Testing (40 hours) ‚Üê tests run automatically in CI

---

### Decision 2: When to Start Phase 2?

**Question:** Should we start Phase 2 (performance/UX) immediately or wait for Phase 1 completion?

**Recommendation:** Complete Phase 1 First

**Rationale:**

- Performance optimization needs testing safety net (prevent regressions)
- UX redesign needs CI/CD (automated testing of new workflows)
- Backend tests prevent API breakage during optimization
- TypeScript strict mode prevents type errors during refactoring

**Blocking Requirements:**

- ‚úÖ Frontend tests (done - 87.29% coverage)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Backend tests (need 60%+ coverage)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è CI/CD pipeline (need automated checks)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è TypeScript strict mode (need type safety)

**Timeline:** Start Phase 2 in ~3 weeks (after Sprint 2 completion)

---

### Decision 3: Next.js Migration Timing

**Question:** When should we evaluate Next.js migration (Phase 4)?

**Recommendation:** Defer to Q1 2026 (After Phase 2 and 3 Complete)

**Rationale:**

- Current Vite/React stack is performant (no immediate need)
- Phase 2 performance work might eliminate perceived need for SSR
- Should optimize current stack before migrating
- Phase 3 architecture work (TanStack Query) might satisfy server state needs
- Next.js migration is high-risk (6-8 weeks effort)

**Prototype Timeline:** After Phase 2 + Phase 3 (Q1 2026)

**Decision Criteria:**

- Does Phase 2 solve performance issues? ‚Üí If yes, defer migration
- Does shareable reports need SSR? ‚Üí Measure actual benefit
- Is team comfortable with Next.js? ‚Üí Training required
- Can we afford 6-8 weeks? ‚Üí Budget vs. benefit analysis

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (High Confidence)

- ‚úÖ CI/CD Pipeline - Well-documented, standard practice
- ‚úÖ Documentation Updates - No code changes
- ‚úÖ TypeScript Strict Mode - IDE support, incremental fixes

### Medium Risk (Manageable)

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Backend Testing - Requires test database setup, API mocking patterns
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance Optimization - Needs profiling first, might require architecture changes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è UI/UX Redesign - User validation required, might need iterations

### High Risk (Requires Careful Planning)

- üî¥ Next.js Migration (Phase 4) - Major framework change, 6-8 weeks effort
- üî¥ Database High Availability (Phase 5) - Infrastructure complexity

## Questions for Team Discussion

1. **CI/CD Deployment:** Should we use SSH deployment or container registry (GHCR)?
   - Current: SSH to server, run deployment scripts
   - Alternative: Push images to GHCR, server pulls images

2. **Coverage Thresholds:** Should we enforce 60% minimum in CI?
   - Blocks PRs if coverage drops below 60%
   - Or just report coverage without blocking?

3. **Backend Test Database:** Use in-memory database or Docker container?
   - In-memory: Faster, simpler
   - Docker: More realistic, matches production

4. **TypeScript Strict Mode:** All at once or incremental?
   - All at once: Fix ~50 errors in one PR
   - Incremental: Enable strict per file

5. **Phase 2 Start Date:** Confirm 3-week timeline for Sprint 2?
   - Can we allocate 88 hours (3 weeks) for remaining work?
   - Or should we prioritize faster delivery?
