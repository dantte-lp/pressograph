# Refactoring Session Summary - 2025-10-31

## Session Overview

**Date:** October 31, 2025
**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Focus:** Refactoring analysis, planning, and Phase 1 (Foundation) initialization
**Status:** Phase 1 infrastructure setup COMPLETE

---

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Refactoring Document Analysis

**Analyzed two comprehensive refactoring proposals:**

#### Document 1: Next.js Migration & UI/UX Overhaul Plan

- **Scope:** Framework migration from Vite to Next.js 13+ App Router
- **Features:** SSR/ISR, file-based routing, middleware authentication
- **Focus:** 10 user stories covering migration, SSR, UX redesign
- **Timeline:** 6-8 weeks estimated

#### Document 2: Technical Upgrade Manifesto (UI/UX Focus)

- **Scope:** Improve usability and industrial UI design (current stack)
- **Features:** 4-step guided workflow, progressive disclosure, enhanced theming
- **Focus:** User feedback addressed ("неудобный интерфейс")
- **Timeline:** 4-6 weeks estimated

**Key Insights:**

- Two different approaches: framework migration vs. current stack optimization
- Both address UI/UX issues but with different technical strategies
- Need to balance risk vs. reward

---

### 2. Documentation Created

#### A. CURRENT_STACK.md (Comprehensive)

**Location:** `/opt/projects/repositories/pressograph/docs/CURRENT_STACK.md`

**Contents:**

- Complete frontend stack documentation (React 19, Vite 7, HeroUI 2.8.5, Tailwind 4)
- Complete backend stack documentation (Node 22, Express, PostgreSQL 18)
- Infrastructure setup (Podman, Traefik, Docker Compose)
- Development environment details
- Build process documentation
- Version management strategy
- **Critical:** Testing status (0% coverage - HIGH PRIORITY ISSUE)
- **Critical:** CI/CD status (manual deployment - HIGH PRIORITY ISSUE)
- Known technical debt catalog (19 items prioritized)

**Key Sections:**

- Mandatory version requirements (DO NOT DOWNGRADE)
- HeroUI 2.8.5 component usage patterns
- Zustand performance optimization (useShallow requirement)
- i18n implementation (custom, 372 keys)
- Canvas API graph rendering details

#### B. REFACTORING_PLAN.md (Strategic Roadmap)

**Location:** `/opt/projects/repositories/pressograph/docs/REFACTORING_PLAN.md`

**Contents:**

- Executive summary with strategic recommendation
- 5-phase roadmap (Sprints 2-6+)
- Detailed task breakdowns with effort estimates
- Migration strategy and risk mitigation
- Success metrics for each phase
- Next.js migration decision framework

**Strategic Recommendation:**

```
Phase 1: Foundation (Sprint 2) - 3 weeks - CRITICAL
Phase 2: Performance & UX (Sprint 3) - 4 weeks - HIGH PRIORITY
Phase 3: Architecture (Sprint 4) - 4 weeks - MEDIUM PRIORITY
Phase 4: Next.js Migration (Sprint 5-6) - 6-8 weeks - EVALUATE FIRST (prototype required)
Phase 5: Advanced Features (Sprint 7+) - Ongoing
```

**Key Decision:** DEFER Next.js migration to Phase 4, prototype first to validate benefits

**Rationale:**

- Establish testing safety net before major framework change
- Deliver UX improvements faster on current stack
- Avoid overwhelming team with simultaneous changes
- Data-driven decision after 2-week prototype

---

### 3. Phase 1 (Foundation) - Infrastructure Setup

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

#### A. Testing Infrastructure

**Installed:**

- ✅ Vitest 4.0.5 (test runner)
- ✅ @vitest/ui 4.0.5 (visual test UI)
- ✅ @vitest/coverage-v8 4.0.5 (coverage reporting)
- ✅ @testing-library/react 16.3.0 (component testing)
- ✅ @testing-library/jest-dom 6.9.1 (DOM matchers)
- ✅ @testing-library/user-event 14.6.1 (user interactions)
- ✅ jsdom 27.1.0 (DOM simulation)
- ✅ happy-dom 20.0.10 (faster DOM alternative)

**Created Files:**

- ✅ `vitest.config.ts` - Test configuration with coverage thresholds (60%)
- ✅ `src/test/setup.ts` - Test environment setup (mocks for localStorage, matchMedia, etc.)
- ✅ `src/utils/helpers.test.ts` - First test suite (13 tests, all passing)

**Test Scripts Added:**

```json
{
  "test": "vitest",
  "test:ui": "vitest --ui",
  "test:coverage": "vitest --coverage",
  "test:watch": "vitest --watch"
}
```

**Initial Test Coverage:**

- ✅ 13 unit tests for utility helpers (100% coverage for helpers.ts)
- ✅ All tests passing (21ms execution)
- ✅ Coverage thresholds configured (60% minimum)

**Test Results:**

```
✓ src/utils/helpers.test.ts (13 tests) 21ms
  Test Files  1 passed (1)
  Tests       13 passed (13)
  Duration    1.16s
```

#### B. CI/CD Pipeline

**Created Files:**

- ✅ `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Complete CI/CD pipeline

**Pipeline Jobs:**

1. **Lint:** ESLint on every PR/push
2. **Test:** Run tests with coverage, upload to Codecov
3. **Build Frontend:** TypeScript + Vite build, upload artifacts
4. **Build Backend:** TypeScript compilation, upload artifacts
5. **Lighthouse CI:** Performance testing on PRs

**Triggers:**

- Push to `master`, `main`, `develop` branches
- All pull requests to `master`, `main`

**Features:**

- Node.js 22 (LTS) via `actions/setup-node@v4`
- NPM caching for faster builds
- Artifact retention (7 days)
- Codecov integration (requires `CODECOV_TOKEN` secret)
- Lighthouse performance budgets (score >90)

**Benefits:**

- Automated quality checks before merge
- No manual builds required
- Early detection of regressions
- Performance monitoring

#### C. Code Quality Tools

**Installed:**

- ✅ Prettier 3.6.2 (code formatter)
- ✅ Husky 9.1.7 (Git hooks)
- ✅ lint-staged 16.2.6 (pre-commit linting)

**Created Files:**

- ✅ `.prettierrc.json` - Prettier configuration
  - Single quotes, semicolons, 100 char line width
  - 2-space tabs, ES5 trailing commas
- ✅ `.prettierignore` - Ignore patterns for Prettier
- ✅ `.husky/pre-commit` - Pre-commit hook (runs lint-staged)
- ✅ `package.json` - lint-staged configuration

**Pre-commit Hook Behavior:**

```bash
# On git commit:
1. Runs ESLint --fix on *.ts, *.tsx files
2. Runs Prettier --write on all staged files
3. Blocks commit if linting fails
4. Auto-formats code before commit
```

**Benefits:**

- Consistent code style across team
- Automatic formatting (no manual intervention)
- Catches linting errors before push
- Reduces code review noise (style is automated)

---

## Technical Decisions Made

### 1. Testing Strategy: Vitest over Jest

**Rationale:**

- Native ESM support (matches Vite)
- Faster execution (shared Vite config)
- Modern API (compatible with Jest, but faster)
- Better TypeScript integration

### 2. Phased Refactoring: Foundation First

**Rationale:**

- Cannot safely refactor without tests (regression risk)
- Manual deployments block rapid iteration
- Code quality baseline needed before migrations
- Lower risk, incremental value delivery

### 3. Next.js Migration: Prototype Before Commit

**Rationale:**

- 6-8 weeks migration effort is HIGH RISK
- Vite + React 19 is already modern and fast
- SSR benefits are limited for authenticated SPA
- Need data-driven decision (not hype-driven)

**Decision Framework:**

```
Prototype → Measure Performance → Evaluate DX → GO/NO-GO Decision
```

### 4. Coverage Target: 60%

**Rationale:**

- Ambitious but achievable for first phase
- Critical paths should be 80%+
- Lower-value code (e.g., UI components) can be <60%
- Focus on high-impact tests (utilities, business logic)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Sprint 2 - Week 1)

1. **Write More Tests** (Target: 60% coverage)
   - Priority: `graphGenerator.ts` (complex logic)

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Test Coverage Target (60%) Too Ambitious

**Mitigation:**

- Focus on high-value tests first (utilities, critical paths)
- Accept lower coverage for UI components initially
- Prioritize quality over quantity
- Extend timeline if needed (better tests than rushed tests)

### Risk 2: CI/CD Pipeline Failures

**Mitigation:**

- Test pipeline locally with `act` (GitHub Actions emulator)
- Start with simple jobs (lint, test) before complex (deploy)
- Add manual approval gates for production deployments
- Keep Makefile as fallback deployment method

### Risk 3: Team Resistance to Pre-commit Hooks

**Mitigation:**

- Document benefits (auto-formatting, catch errors early)
- Provide escape hatch (`git commit --no-verify` for emergencies)
- Keep hooks fast (<5 seconds)
- Gather feedback and adjust if too strict

### Risk 4: Next.js Migration Pressure

**Mitigation:**

- Show data: Vite is already fast (Lighthouse >90)
- Emphasize risk: 6-8 weeks vs. proven stack
- Propose prototype: 2 weeks before decision
- Document decision rationale (this plan)

---

---

## Team Communication

### Share with Team

1. **Read Documents:**
   - `/docs/CURRENT_STACK.md` - Understand current architecture
   - `/docs/REFACTORING_PLAN.md` - Review roadmap and phases

2. **Setup Local Environment:**
   - `npm install` (installs new testing dependencies)
   - `npm test` (verify tests pass)
   - `git commit` (verify pre-commit hooks work)

3. **Provide Feedback:**
   - Review refactoring plan (approve phases)
   - Comment on Next.js migration decision (GO/NO-GO)
   - Suggest priority changes (what's most painful now?)

4. **Start Writing Tests:**
   - Follow pattern in `helpers.test.ts`
   - Target utilities and business logic first
   - Ask questions if stuck (testing is new)

### Questions for Team Discussion

1. **Next.js Migration:** Do we wait for prototype (recommended) or skip entirely?
2. **Coverage Target:** Is 60% realistic for Sprint 2, or should we aim for 40%?
3. **UX Redesign:** Which UI issues are most painful for users right now?
4. **Deployment:** When can we enable automated deployments (need server access)?
